# Week 1

$\Large {Origins\  of\  Industry\ 4.0}$ 
- The German Academy of Science and Technology, _acatech_, played a pivotal role in shaping the concept of Industrie 4.0. Initially, Industrie 4.0 referred to a team of scientists and industry representatives. With acatech's guidance, this concept evolved into a central focus of the German federal administration's digital agenda, transforming a research topic into a globally recognized initiative for industrial digitization.

$\Large {Progression}$ 
- **1.0: Steam**
    - Mechanization and use of steam power.
    
- **2.0: Assembly Line**
    - Mass production and electric power.
    
- **3.0: IT**
    - Introduction of computers, IT, CNC (Computer Numerical Control), and robotics.
    
- **4.0: IoT (Internet of Things)**
    - Autonomous systems, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and digitization.

$\Large {Geographical\   Origins}$ 
- 1st revolution – England (James Watt, Manchester) [then went to France,
  Germany before reaching USA].

- 2nd revolution – USA (Graham Bell, Henry Ford) [went to Europe.]

- 3rd revolution – USA? Japan? (CNC, automation, robotics, IT) [Matched the
  progression of IT spread.]

- 4th revolution – Germany (acatech, Wolfgang Wahlster, Hanover Fair) [all-
  reaching]
