$\Large {Origins\  of\  Industry\ 4.0}$ 
- The German Academy of Science and Technology, _acatech_, played a pivotal role in shaping the concept of Industrie 4.0. Initially, Industrie 4.0 referred to a team of scientists and industry representatives. With acatech's guidance, this concept evolved into a central focus of the German federal administration's digital agenda, transforming a research topic into a globally recognized initiative for industrial digitization.

$\Large {Progression}$ 
- **1.0: Steam**
    - Mechanization and use of steam power.
    
- **2.0: Assembly Line**
    - Mass production and electric power.
    
- **3.0: IT**
    - Introduction of computers, IT, CNC (Computer Numerical Control), and robotics.
    
- **4.0: IoT (Internet of Things)**
    - Autonomous systems, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and digitization.


$\Large {Communication,\  Transport,\  and\  Energy}$  
|Revolution|Communication|Transportation|Energy|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1st Revolution**|Printing press|Steam locomotive|Steam|
|**2nd Revolution**|Telephone|Combustion engine|Crude oil|
|**3rd Revolution**|E-mail|Hybrid/Electric vehicles|Electricity|
|**4th Revolution**|?|?|?|

$\Large {Geographical\   Origins}$ 
- 1st revolution – England (James Watt, Manchester) [then went to France,
  Germany before reaching USA].

- 2nd revolution – USA (Graham Bell, Henry Ford) [went to Europe.]

- 3rd revolution – USA? Japan? (CNC, automation, robotics, IT) [Matched the
  progression of IT spread.]

- 4th revolution – Germany (acatech, Wolfgang Wahlster, Hanover Fair) [all-
  reaching]


$\Large {History\   of\  Digitization}$
- first digital computers -Z3 (Zuse), ABC(Atnasoff Berry Computer), etc.
- Moore's Law (Gorden Moore, 1970).
- Development of PLC(NC and CNC machines).
- IT and ICT
- Role of IPv6(2010)


$\Large {Phases\  of\  digitization}$ 
Hardware     --->     Software     --->     Smart 
(IBM,Cisco,Apple)    (Microsoft, Google)     (Google, Deepmind, ?)


$\Large {Industial\  internet\  /IIOT/\  Industry4.0}$ 
- Three forms of internet - Consumer, Commertial, industrial
- All of them have "IoT" base. They have different target audiences, technical requirements, and strategies.
- The consumer market has market visibility (e.g. smart homes, personal connectivity via monitors, entertainment integrated devices.)
- Commercial market has high marketability as they have services that encompass financial and investment products such as banking, insurance, financial services, and e-commerce.
- Enterprise IoT includes small, medium and large scale business.

$\Large {IIoT\  vs.\  Industry 4.0}$ 

$\textbf {Internet of things}$  
- The term "Internet of things" dates from the late 1990s.
- As technology evolved everyday deices and products that we use would eventually "talk" to each other and to network servers, in the interest of improving their performance.
- The "Internet of things" can be seen as connected to "smart" devices - televisions, refrigerators, wristwatches and more. 

$\textbf {Industrial Internet of things}$ 
- The term "Industrial internet of things" distinguishes manufacturing devices from consumer deices, yet the underlying concept is the same.
- IIoT devices are wirelessly connected to internal networks as well as to the global internet. These devices represent a new phase in automation - collecting an unprecedented amount of data from all aspects of a process and sharing it with a central server.
- This data enables analysis and action that has been heretofore unseen, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity. 

$\textbf {Industry 4.0}$ 
- “Industry 4.0” refers to the 4th Industrial Revolution: the advances
   and innovations enabled by connected devices; massive amounts of
   computing power; and the modern-day importance of lean, efficient
   operations.
-  IIoT is a component of Industry 4.0, but not as an interchangeable
   term. Without the connectivity and data that IIoT provides, Industry
   4.0 would not exist, let alone be as impactful on efficiency. IIoT
   enables further analysis and action, and is a key driver of Industry 4.0.

$\textbf {Similarities}$ 
- Efficiency- and results-oriented: Both IIoT and Industry 4.0 are intended to
  streamline production processes and keep manufacturing viable and
  profitable.
- Technology-driven: IIoT and Industry 4.0 would not be possible without
  today’s high-speed, wireless, integrated Internet connectivity.
- People-driven: Automation, implemented in both IIoT and Industry 4.0, can
  only make existing processes faster and more efficient. It can’t develop new
  processes or take over by itself. People with the knowledge of how to
  interpret and implement data and actions provided by this technology are
  key to its return on investment.

$\textbf {Differnces}$ 
- Scope: IIoT will almost always refer exclusively to the equipment in a facility (and any
  potential off-site server locations). Industry 4.0 comprises IIoT, and places it into a
  much larger context of analysis, action and long-term sustainability for the
  manufacturing field.Scope: IIoT will almost always refer exclusively to the equipment in a facility (and any potential off-site server locations). Industry 4.0 comprises IIoT, and places it into a much larger context of analysis, action and long-term sustainability for the manufacturing field.
- Action: In many ways, IIoT is a technology implementation — whether referring to
  new, connected devices; or retrofitted sensors, data transmitters, wireless
  equipment, etc. Industry 4.0 is more of a philosophy that is driven by technology like
  IIoT, but maintains a wider scope and a bigger-picture vision. IIoT may be manifested
  in equipment investment, but Industry 4.0 is manifested by buy-in among
  management and leadership
