- The German Academy of Science and Technology, _acatech_, played a pivotal role in shaping the concept of Industrie 4.0.

With acatech's guidance, this concept evolved into a central focus of the German federal administration's digital agenda, transforming a research topic into a globally recognized initiative for industrial digitization.
